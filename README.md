# Open Courses Manifesto


## 1. Sharing Knowledge
The project aims at sharing knowledge by distributing the material as open source, under a MIT licence. Before sharing any content make sure you have the right to do it.
## 2. Open to anyone
The project will be maintained by the IEEE-HKN members. However, the content must be open to everyone with an internet connection.
## 3. Learn by doing
Exercises take most of the learning material. The format for them devises a unique instructional text, and one, or more possible solutions.
## 4. Constructivist material
The platform should guarantee an incremental learning process, where concepts build up one on the top of the other: many simple exercises are better than few complex ones.
## 5. Foster discussion and collaboration
The project must provide an easy way for contributors and users to communicate, allowing crowdsourcing and open discussions.
## 6. Grant usability and accessibility 
The project courses must be compatible with different learning methodologies and provide support at different levels of knowledge.
## 7. Easy to maintain and contribute
The solution should be based on well-known open source tools and procedures able to reduce the overall maintenance costs and allows an easy contribution flow.
## 8. Highly scalable
In future expansions the solution must maintain a high scalability level, allowing unlimited contributors, organizing them with different roles and access policies.
## 9. Hierarchical and open organization
The project should publicly define the organization structure, identifying the position represented by each contributor in an open and verifiable way.
## 10. High quality material
The quality of the material must be constantly monitored by one or more maintainers for each course, addressing userâ€™s feedback and ensuring compliance with the project best practices.
